Description: 
 YouTube Music Widget is a simple web application that allows you to add music from YouTube to any local video you upload. With this app, you can easily create customized videos for your Instagram stories or any other platform that requires background music.

Use case for this: 
 I live in a region where I don't have access to Instagram music, and I wanted a way to add music to my stories. This app lets me easily add any music from YouTube to my videos without any hassle. Another use case might be to add sounds from YouTube that you can't normally find on Instagram.

1. Enter the YouTube URL of the song you want to use.
2. Select which part of the song you want to use.
3. Upload your local video.
4. Adjust the music and video to your liking.
5. inal video processed, share it on any platform.
